These build notes were sent to the CGEN mailing list 19-June-2015:

1) put guile 1.8.8 in $PATH

[no special configure options are needed, just --prefix]

2) check out cgen

bash$ cd /place/to/put/cgen
bash$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sourceware.org:/cvs/src co cgen

2b) make sure the build can find it

bash$ ln -s $(pwd)/src/cgen $git/cgen

There's a TODO to be able to specify the path to cgen
when configuring binutils,gdb.
I've always just done this hack when I need it.

3) apply this patch

https://sourceware.org/ml/gdb-patches/2015-06/msg00395.html

4) Build all the sims.
Generated files that need regenerating will be,
including the opcodes files.

bash$ cd $build
bash$ $git/configure --prefix=$(pwd)/rel \
    --enable-cgen-maint \
    --enable-targets=all \
    --enable-sim
bash$ make all-sim

If/when some form of (3) gets applied, and the TODO is done,
the steps should be simple enough.

Heads up, if you try this today there are two other outstanding patches
to cgen that affect the generated files.
